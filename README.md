## The Game
Ealdred's Saga is a game where you need to help Ealdred Stormblade get out of the Forbidden Forest. Defeat or escape the Oculwings and finally, defeat the great Pyroclaw Dragon.

Use the 'a' and 'd' keys on your keyboard to move the character, the 'space' key to jump, the 'f' key to shoot arrows and the right mouse button to attack.

### Important Tips:

- It is possible to attack with the sword in the air, but not to launch arrows;
- Don't fall into the water, or it's Game Over;
- In combat with the Dragon, it is important to know that he reads your movements, that is, if you jump, he will also jump. This can be useful if you want to bypass it;
- The Dragon takes a lot of damage, but you don't, so be careful;
- Finally, during the battle with the Dragon, PowerUps will drop in a certain period of time, in this case, it is better to wait a little.


## Details
- Character Animation: Fluid and realistic animations to bring your character to life, making the gaming experience more immersive.
- Platoform Movement: Intuitive movements, allowing the player to move forward, backward and jump.
- Creating Maps with Tilesets and Palettes: Using tilesets and palettes to create detailed and visually attractive maps, providing a rich and varied environment.

## Game Writing
Ealdred Stormblade, descendant of a noble lineage, is summoned for a mission that will test not only his combat skills, but also his wisdom and compassion. The Forbidden Forest, a place filled with mystery and danger, is under threat from a growing darkness, emanating from an ancient evil.

Equipped with his legendary sword, Dawnbolt, and a bow forged by the kingdom's finest craftsmen, Ealdred sets out into the forest. Soon, he comes across the Oculwings, shadow-corrupted creatures with only one large eye that plague the forest.

Ealdred's journey is punctuated by intense combat with the Oculwings. He uses his sword to deliver quick and precise blows, and his bow to strike the shadowy eyes of creatures from a distance. With each victory, the darkness that envelops the forest seems to recede, but the true source of evil waits in the heart of the dense vegetation.

Arriving at the central clearing, Ealdred comes across Pyroclaw, the magnificent dragon who is now imprisoned by shadow. The battle against Pyroclaw is epic and challenging. The dragon releases violent flames, testing Ealdred's abilities. With each attack, Ealdred's sword shines brightly, driving away the darkness. Only by defeating this Dragon can Ealdred leave the forest.
